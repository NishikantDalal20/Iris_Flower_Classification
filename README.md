# Iris Species Classification

This project uses machine learning to predict Iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements.

### Models Used
- K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes

### Dataset
Iris dataset from `sklearn` with four physical features and three species classes.

### Result
Logistic Regression achieved the best accuracy among all models.

### Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
